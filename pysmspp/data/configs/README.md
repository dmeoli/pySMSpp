# Description of available configuration files

- UCBlock/{uc_solverconfig.txt, OSolCfg.txt} copied from smspp-project/tools/ucblock_solver.
- InvestmentBlock/{BSPar.txt, uc_solverconfig.txt}, copied from smspp-project/InvestmentBlock/test/config.
- TSSBlock/* copied from smspp-project/tools/tssb_solver.
- SVMBlock/* copied from smspp-project/tests/SVMBlock and smspp-project/tools/svm_solver.

For SVMBlock, SVMCfg.txt and SVMCfg-primal.txt are BlockConfig, which is what chooses the formulation of the training problem the abstract representation encodes, respectively the Wolfe dual and the training problem itself; SVMSCfg.txt trains the model with the ad hoc SMOSolver, SVMSCfg_grb.txt with Gurobi and SVMSCfg-LD.txt with a LagrangianDualSolver, the last one applying to the Block that the svm_solver option "s" assembles rather than to the SVMBlock itself.

For uc_solverconfig in both folders, the version using Gurobi is also provided under name uc_solverconfig_grb.
The template configuration option for OSolCfg.txt allows to extract the most information from tools.

The configurations that use the BundleSolver, i.e., InvestmentBlock/BSPar.txt, SDDPBlock/BSPar-LD.txt, SDDPBlock/BSPar-greedy-LD.txt, SVMBlock/LDCfg.txt, TSSBlock/TSSBSCfg-LD.txt and TSSBlock/LPBSCfg-LD.txt, are written for the BundleSolver 2.0, whose master problem is a Block of its own: `intMPStbl` chooses its stabilization and `strMPBSolverCfg` names the BlockSolverConfig of its Solver, the MPBCfg.txt of the same folder, which solves it with Gurobi. The parameters of the master of the BundleSolver 1.0 (`intMPName`, `intMPlvl`, `intQPmp1`, `intQPmp2`, `intOSImp1`, `intOSImp2`, `intOSImp3`, `dblCtOff`) are gone, and a name the SMS++ at hand does not know makes its whole ComputeConfig fail to load, so these files do not load with an SMS++ whose bundle is the 1.0. The MPBCfg.txt of SVMBlock is the one of the tests of the SVMBlock, which turns the presolve of the master off; the others leave it on, which the masters of the stochastic and investment problems need.
