# Release Notes

## Upcoming Release

### New Features and Major Changes

* Mirror the repository to its GitLab copy, `smspp/pysmspp`, at every push on `main`: SMS++ lives on GitLab and mirrors itself to GitHub, pySMSpp is the one going the other way round.

* 

### Minor Changes and Bug Fixes

* Update the shipped `BlockConfig` files to the current format: SMS++ now reads a version number after the differential flag and the structure `Configuration` first, so the shipped file was rejected, with the `-B` option silently having no effect. See [PR #110](https://github.com/SPSUnipi/pySMSpp/pull/110)
